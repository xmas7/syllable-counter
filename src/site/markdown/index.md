Overview
--------

Syllable counter is a very small, one-purpose, KISS library to count syllables
in a word.

It uses a fallback methodâ€”based on the [NLTK readability plugin][nltk] by
Thomas Jakobsen <thomj05@student.uia.no> and Thomas Skardal
<thomas04@student.uia.no>. This NLTK plugin is itself based on the
algorithm implemented in the [Lingua::EN::Syllable perl module][perl]
by Greg Fast <gdf@imsa.edu>.

Thanks to them for making their work available.

Requirements
------------

Java 8 is necessary to use this library.
